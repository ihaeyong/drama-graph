#ESFWN-based ESL Annotator
The ESFWN is the **E**vent **S**tructure **F**rame-annotated **W**ord**N**et in which the proper Event Structure Frame is annotated for each synset of verbs in WordNet. The ESFWN-based ESL Annotator is an automatic annotation tool of the Event Structure Lexicon (ESL) for verbs in text using ESFWN. The resulting ESL for each verb in a sentence includes the followings:

* Sentence (e.g. "My daughter's wedding ceremony is cancelled.")

* Verb text (e.g. "

* Verb lemma

* WordNet offset

* WordNet synset number

* Synonyms

* Hypernyms

* Event Structure Frame type

* Event Structure Frame
  
The ESFWN-based ESL Annotator relies on [EWISER](https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/ewiser) and [AllenNLP-SRL](https://demo.allennlp.org/semantic-role-labeling).
